# NonHermitianSystems
Code for paper "Transport and Integrability Breaking in Non-Hermitian Quantum Systems"

TODO: In this file I should specify which versions I'm using of all of the packages I've installed.

TODO: add a bunch of comments to code

TODO: make sure that all links are to stable sources

TODO: Note that there's two different notions of projector in this code: one goes from a vector space of a larger dimension to one of a smaller dimension, while one goes from a vector space to itself while its image lies in a subspace of the whole vector space
