# NonHermitianSystems
Code for paper "Transport and Integrability Breaking in Non-Hermitian Quantum Systems"

TODO: In this file I should specify which versions I'm using of all of the packages I've installed.

TODO: add a bunch of comments to code

TODO: make sure that all links are to stable sources

TODO: Note that there's two different notions of projector in this code: one goes from a vector space of a larger dimension to one of a smaller dimension, while one goes from a vector space to itself while its image lies in a subspace of the whole vector space

TODO: Note that RawData also includes data created during testing that isn't used in the actual plots, as well as all of the plotted data. Provide pointer to the data ctually used in plotting.

TODO: Note that some large pickle files from the diagonalization of the current operator may not be synced to GitHub
